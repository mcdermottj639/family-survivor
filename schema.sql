-- Family Survivor League — Supabase schema.
-- Paste this whole file into the Supabase SQL editor and run it once.
--
-- ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE THE FAMILY LINKS GO OUT
--
-- 1. SEED THE COMMISSIONER HERE, NOT IN THE APP. `admin_add_player` lets the
--    FIRST caller become admin while `players` is empty, and the anon key is
--    public the moment the site deploys. So insert your own row in this SQL
--    editor before the URL is shared, rather than racing for it in the UI:
--       select admin_add_player('bootstrap', 'Jack');
--    Then mark yourself claimed so your own name is not offered to anyone else:
--       update players set claimed_at = now() where is_admin;
--    then read your token back with:  select token from players;
--
-- 2. "PICKS ARE HIDDEN UNTIL KICKOFF" IS A UI CONVENTION, NOT A SECURITY
--    BOUNDARY. The client computes standings itself, so it must read every
--    pick, so `picks` is readable by anyone with the anon key — which is in
--    the public JS. Anyone willing to open dev tools can see this week's
--    picks early. For a family pool that is an acceptable trade; do NOT
--    describe it to players as impossible. Closing it properly means storing
--    kickoff times server-side and gating reads behind a function.
--
-- The shape of the rest of the security model:
--   * The anon key sits in a public JS file. That is normal and safe HERE
--     only because of what follows.
--   * `players` holds everyone's personal token and is NOT readable by the
--     anon key. The app reads `players_public`, a view without that column,
--     so nobody can scrape the roster and pick as somebody else.
--   * There are no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies on any table. Every write
--     goes through a SECURITY DEFINER function below that checks the token
--     first. The tables cannot be written to directly.
--   * The no-repeat-a-team rule is a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, not a UI check.
--     Two open tabs or a stale phone page cannot get around it.

-- 🚨 NO pgcrypto. Tokens used `gen_random_bytes` from it, and on Supabase
-- extensions install into the `extensions` schema — while every function
-- below is hardened with `set search_path = public`, which cannot see it. So
-- `admin_add_player` failed with "function gen_random_bytes(integer) does not
-- exist" the first time it was ever called on a real database. Dropping the
-- hardening to fix that would be the wrong trade: it is what stops a
-- search_path attack on a SECURITY DEFINER function.
-- `gen_random_uuid()` is a PostgreSQL BUILT-IN (13+) living in pg_catalog,
-- which is always on the search path whatever it is set to. Same 6 hex
-- characters of randomness, no extension, hardening intact.
