/* Family Survivor League — service worker.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   The whole point: when the commissioner ships a change, every phone
   picks it up on the next open, with nobody clearing a cache or
   reinstalling anything.

   NETWORK-FIRST. Every same-origin request goes to the network with
   `cache: 'no-store'`, which bypasses both the browser's HTTP cache and
   GitHub Pages' ~10-minute one. The Cache API copy is only ever the
   offline fallback. That is the opposite of the usual cache-first PWA
   advice, and it is deliberate — for this app being CURRENT matters far
   more than being fast, and the files are a few KB.

   ⚠️ This replaces the `?v=N` query-string ritual, which had already
   failed: survivor.js changed 16 times while index.html still asked for
   `?v=1`, so a returning phone could have served a months-old copy. */

/* Bumped with APP_V in survivor.js. Nothing here reads it — its whole job is
   to make this FILE different on a ship, because a browser only looks for a
   new worker when sw.js itself changed byte-wise. Forgetting it costs only
   the weaker of the app's two update signals (the page also fingerprints
   survivor.js directly), but bump it anyway. */
